# Superstore Sales Analysis Project
This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Superstore sales dataset spanning four years. The goal is to gain insights and identify sales trends across various dimensions.

# Tech Stack
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
# Data Exploration and Cleaning
- The dataset is imported into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- Initial data exploration includes examining the structure, dimensions, and columns of the DataFrame.
- Null values in the dataset are identified and addressed, ensuring data integrity.
- The data types of specific columns are modified to facilitate analysis.

# Visualizations
The project includes a range of visualizations to uncover sales trends and patterns. Some of the key visualizations performed are:

- Histogram: Displaying the distribution of sales.
- Timeline: Analyzing sales trends over time by year and month.
- Region: Analyzing sales performance across different regions.
- Category: Examining sales distribution across various product categories.
- Customer: Identifying the top customers based on sales.
- Ship Mode: Analyzing the distribution of sales by shipment mode.
- Segment: Investigating sales distribution across customer segments.
- Each visualization is accompanied by appropriate labels and titles for clarity and understanding.

This Superstore Sales Analysis project demonstrates the effective use of Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights into sales trends and patterns across different dimensions.
